/**
 * Collectme V2
 * API specification for the Collectme V2 WordPress plugin.  **Authentication**  Users may authenticate themselves using the `/users/form-auth` or `/users/link-auth` endpoints. Authentication works with the following two cookies:   - `WP_COLLECTME_AUTH`: Persistent login. Cookie contains the persistent session's `uuid` and a secret that    corresponds to the `session_hash`. - `PHPSESSID`: Session login. Cookie contains the PHP session id.  While `WP_COLLECTME_AUTH` keeps the user logged in (for 5 years), the session cookie has a short ttl (default  session duration) but better performance. The session cookie therefore takes precedence over the `WP_COLLECTME_AUTH` cookie. Both cookies must be deleted, to log the user out.  All protected functions do also need a nonce for CSRF protection. The nonce must be sent in the  `X-WP-Collectme-Nonce` header. It can be obtained from the global JS variable `collectme.nonce`, which is set by the  `HtmlController`.
